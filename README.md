# Hangman Game in Python

## Description

This code implements the classic game **"Hangman"**, where the user has to guess a word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, the player loses a life, and a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the user guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## Features:
- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Displaying progress with underscores representing the unguessed letters.
- Reducing lives on incorrect guesses.
- Visual representation of the hangman figure as lives decrease.
- Notifications when the game is won or lost.

## Purpose:
This code was created during my study of **Python** to solidify key programming concepts such as working with strings, lists, conditional statements, loops, and random numbers. It is part of my learning journey and development of programming skills.

## Technologies:
- **Python 3.x**
